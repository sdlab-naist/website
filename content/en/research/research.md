## [Design & Analysis of Software Process](/en/project/software-process/)
Recently in software development, due to the increase in scale and complexity,
thousands of developers and dozens of company are usually involved in
developing a huge software system. In this research group, we aim at
mitigating such complexity and exploring solutions that support developers for
smoother development process.

## [Software Repository Mining](/en/project/repository-mining/)
Software Repository refers to a development infrastructure that allows
developers to collaborate among others for software development via network.
It is also a collective term of version control system that manages source
code, as well as a mailing list management system that keeps track of
discussions among developers. Within software repository, immensive amount of
development history data is stored. By exploiting these data, the goal of this
research field is to perform integration that filters out irrelevant
information and summarizes the commons. Furthermore, it also aims at providing
developers with useful information in a comprehensible way. Such activities
are called as Software Repository Mining.

## [Software Analytics](/en/project/software-analytics/)
Software analytics aims at helping individual or team to make better decision
in software development. For this reason, software-related data such as source
code or development history is analyzed. Afterwards, the corresponding result
is provided in a way that can be shared among individual or team.

## [Software for Cloud Computing](/en/project/cloud-computing/)
Recently, in the rapidly emerging cloud computing technology, dynamically and
automatically constructing as well as allocating computing environment by
virtualizing computing resource based on software technology has been
gathering attentions. In our research, we aim at manipulating computing
resource by utilizing software technique. Specifically, Software Defined
Networking (SDN) which is a software-based networking-control technique is in
our main focus. Based on SDN, we hope to extend and advance software
techniques that can support cloud computing-related technologies such as Cloud
Gaming, Big Data Analysis, Machine Learning, IoT and etc.

## [Software for High-Performance Computing](/en/project/high-performance-computing/)
High-Performance Computing Systems (i.e., Supercomputers) provide massive
computing performance to solve diverse problems in science and engineering. At
our laboratory, we research and develop software to fully utilize the
performance of state-of-the-art HPC systems. We develop massively parallel
scientific applications in close collaboration with domain scientists.
Furthermore, we design and implement middleware for large-scale HPC systems.
