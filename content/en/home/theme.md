At SDLab, we are conducting research on techniques that support software
development. Our current research topics include:

- Analysis of software-related data such as source code and development
  history
- Analysis of development process and software design
- Virtualization technology, in particular SDN (Software Defined Networking)
- Software analytics (data analysis that helps developers to understand the
  progress of software development projects and make better decisions)

Please see [here](/en/research) for details.
