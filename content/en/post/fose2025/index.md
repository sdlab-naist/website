Tatsuya Shirai, Keitaro Ito, Ayane Shirakawa, and Kan Watanabe from our laboratory presented at the [32nd Workshop on Foundations of Software Engineering (FOSE2025)](https://fose.jssst.or.jp/fose2025/), taken place in Ehime prefecture from November 6-8, 2025.

Shirai presented "An Empirical Study on the Impact of Programming Languages in Fuzzing." This research focused on fuzzing, an automated software testing technique, and conducted a large-scale analysis of how the characteristics of different programming languages affect fuzzing results. The findings revealed significant differences between languages in terms of detected bug patterns and metrics such as coverage, demonstrating the importance of optimizing fuzzing methods according to language characteristics.
